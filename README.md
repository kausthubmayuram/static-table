# StaticTable

A Simple Library to use the Static table at multiple components without having to repeat the code.
Table works dynamically. Just pass the Parameters to the Component.

## Limitations

Currently the plugin only supports passing the data with a specific format.
Further versions would include option to configure the format which the module should use.
Stylings are not included for the table so as to keep/provide freedom to the users to customise as the require.
